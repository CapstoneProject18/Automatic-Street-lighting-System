# AutoLight : Automated Street Lighting System using IOT

## Short Description:
"Automated Street Lighting System" is a smart street lighting system that can be used in any city. All the street lights are simultaneously connected to each other and to the cloud.
Generic street lights have just two options â€“ ON & OFF, they cannot be adjusted or controlled according to the amount of light present in the environment and hence lead to energy wastage. The smart street lights turn on/off automatically based on the amount of sunlight present in the area.
In general, during the day time all lights would remain off. During night time all lights would automatically turn on with around 10% intensity and be in the energy saver mode. Whenever the lights sense an object (any vehicle or any human) around its vicinity, the lights around the object would turn to maximum intensity and adjust according to the movement of the object. In case any light malfunctions or stops working, a notification would be sent to the cloud, where the person monitoring can send a repair van immediately.
Each smart light would send data to the cloud for storage and analysis. We would show results like the amount of energy consumed and saved, duration for which lights were ON, etc.

### Prerequisites
python 3.0

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
